# Automated Developer Macbook Setup
Today every versatile developer as a bunch of IDE's, browsers and development tools he needs every day. 
I didn't want to waste my time to setup these tools every time a get a new developer macbook. Therfore
I have created an `autosetup.sh` bash script that will do this for me. 

Also have a look at sample `.bash_profile` that defines common aliases and scripts and 
alter it for your needs. All you have to do is to clone repo and read an interesting book while
your computer is installing. 


```
cd ~/Repos
git clone https://github.com/tkausch/macbook.git
./autosetup.sh
